#Assignment 4
#Given the following list  and apply the bubble sort:
#Write down the contents of the list after each step of the iteration for all interations.(Note you can use an excel table to organize your resutls.)
#Extra credit) Write a function that loads an unsorted list, and returns a sorted list (note: part 1 can be integrated into part 2, that as your function execute, you can print the result of each step)

#Define a list
lis1 = [ 32, 39, 44, 67, 75, 3, 18, 29] 

#Define a function to sort this list
def sortList(tmpList):
   count = 1
   print "The original order is:", tmpList #print the original list
   for i in range(len(tmpList)): #cycle through each position
      for j in range(len(tmpList)-1): #cycle through and swap
         if tmpList[j] > tmpList[j+1]: #if number at a given index is larger than the next one swap
            small = tmpList[j+1] #store the smaller value
            tmpList[j+1] = tmpList[j] #change value in list to a higher position
            tmpList[j] = small #put smaller value in the right spot
            print "Then we swapped like this during round", count, ":", tmpList #print the newly swapped list
         count += 1
         
sortList(lis1) #executes the function above
